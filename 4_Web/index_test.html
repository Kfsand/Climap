                fans, have you ever wondered who performed best in the World Cup during their times, and
                how they compare to today's top athletes? Whether athletes are more or less versatile than before? Or are
                you just looking for an easy way to review the complete history of the World Cup? Well, wonder no more, as
                we will accompany you and show you the features we have brought to shed some light on these questions!</p>
    
                <p>These visualizations allow you to bring your own conclusions about the evolution of the sport and its
                    athletes. A wide variety of chopice awaits you, and here is a short presentation of everything that is
                    available.</p>
    
                <h3>Parameters</h3>
    
                <p>Before diving into all the different components, take some time to set your parameters. Choose your year
                    using the slider at the bottom and whether you would like to look at the women's or men's results, and
                    you
                    are then good to go!</p>
    
                <h3>Dynamic rankings</h3>
    
                <p>The top-left component allows you the relive the World Cup ranking evolution as they happened at the
                    time!
                    Who was a main contender? Why did this slalom specialist suddenly participate in downhill events? This
                    visualization tells you everything you need and want to know. Skiers have also the color of their
                    favorite
                    type of event, computed for each season. Instead of letting the animation play out for you, you can
                    simply
                    control it using the slider in the control box.</p>
    
                <h3>Event map & race results</h3>
    
                <p>The map shows all events of a given season. It evolves according to the progression of the season in the
                    bar
                    chart race. When you click on a given event, you can choose which race results you want to display in
                    the
                    top-right panel.</p>
    
                <h3>Similarity graph</h3>
    
                <p>The graph (bottom-middle component) shows how skiers are <i>linked</i> between each other during a given
                    season. You can generally notice a group of technicians and another one of speed specialists. Every
                    skier
                    in-between is versatile and competes in all types of events.</p>
    
                <h3>Skier profile</h3>
    
                <p>Finally, the bottom-right component links everything together. It displays the information we have about
                    a
                    specific athlete, and shows graphs about the mean number of points he gathers per event, and all his
                    World
                    Cup points during his whole career. Each component is linked to the profile, so you can always know more
                    about this one skier who almost won the Wolrd Cup. There is also a search bar with autocomplete
                    available!
                </p>
                <h3>More help</h3>
    
                <p>To non-specialists, here is a small dictionary:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>DH</b>: Downhill</li>
                    <li><b>SG</b>: Super G</li>
                    <li><b>GS</b>: Giant Slalom</li>
                    <li><b>SL</b>: Slalom</li>
                    <li><b>AC</b>: (Alpine) Combined</li>
                    <li><b>PAR</b>: Parallel</li>
                    <li><b>NQ</b>: Not qualified</li>
                    <li><b>AB</b>: Abandon</li>
                </ul>
